self-training will be better than transfer-learning.

but we'll spend more time to training the model.

[pre-train, self-train, joint-train](https://www.kaggle.com/stanleyjzheng/exploring-pseudolabelling-schemes-pydata)

If we wanna use this technique, we need more training time and a custom loss function which can be called.
