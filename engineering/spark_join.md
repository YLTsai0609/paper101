# Abstract

1. spark join : memory resources, networkIO, diskIO
2. Catalyst as query optimizer
   1. rule-based optimizer strategy (RBO) - in memory computing in Spark was not fully considered.
   2. cost-based optimizer strategy (CBO) - the cost estimation of network transfer and diskIO is insufficient.
3. proposed a cost estimation model for join operator which take the cost from 4 aspects
   1. time complexity
   2. space complexity
   3. network transfer
   4. disk IO
4. most cost-efficiency plan could be selected by using hierarchical analysis method from equivalence physical plans which generated by Spark SQL
