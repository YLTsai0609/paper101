# abstract

1. combine the advantages of SVM with factorlizationm models
2. FM model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters.
3. FM is able to estimate interactions with huge sparsity.
4. FM can be calculated in linear time.
5. FM can easily apply without expert knowledge.
6. FM can mimic these models(matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF, FPMC)
